Summary

For my Computer Science Bachelor's thesis, I tackled the challenge of building and evaluating deep learning models for pedestrian attribute recognition using the PAR2025 dataset with over 105,000 images.

I implemented and compared four different architectures: CNNs (ResNet18, EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2) and Vision Transformers (ViT), training them to simultaneously classify five attributes: upper clothing color, lower clothing color, gender, bag presence, and hat presence.

Beyond the dataset, I tested my models on real-world images (OOD - Out of Distribution) to evaluate their generalization capabilities, exploring both individual and multi-task learning approaches.

This repository documents my implementation, experiments, and learnings throughout this journey in computer vision and deep learning.
